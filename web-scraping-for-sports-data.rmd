# What is Web Scraping?

## Web Scraping Background

-   **Web scraping**: programmatically gathering data from web-based sources
- Premade datasets:
    - Kaggle, GitHub, data.gov, etc.
    - May or may not contain what you need
- Websites contain **huge amounts of data**
    - Format is a barrier of access
    - Data displayed in UI
        - Elements of complex webpages
- Web scraping used to **unpack data from webpages**

## Why Web Scraping is Useful

## Static vs. Dynamic
- Static webpages:
    - Content will not change
- Dynamic webpages:
    - Content can be altered, loaded, etc. with JavaScript
    - Common with modern websites
- Methods to interact with both kinds
- Combination of both can be used
