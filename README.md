If you want to start analyzing sports, you need data. Nowaways, there are many sources of pre-built datasets, but at times, you might have a need to make a custom dataset with data found online. Web scraping is the most effective solution to this problem. You can create automated scripts that can quickly and efficiently gather data from webpages. In doing so, you can create datasets specific to the questions that you want to be answered. During this workshop you will learn 1) what web scraping is, 2) how static web scraping works using Python packages pandas, requests, and BeautifulSoup, then 3) how dynamic web scraping works using Python package Selenium in conjunction with the previously learned packages.
